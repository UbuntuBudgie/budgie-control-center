budgie-control-center (1.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bug-fix
    d/control - remove B/D on cheese.
    d/rules - Drop cheese support for taking user pictures.  This has been

    work anyway.

budgie-control-center (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * Packaging Changes
    - remove control.in usage since this is now deprecated
    - d/control B/D dh-sequence-gnome has been removed
    - d/control B/D remove libgoa-1.0-dev and libgoa-backend-1.0-dev
      since gnome-online-accounts support has been removed from this release;
      the recommendation has also been removed.
    - d/rules compile with ssh=true for socket based Ubuntu sshd.
    - d/rules override the SSHD-Socket name since Debian/Ubuntu used "ssd"
      rather than the upstream "sshd" convention

budgie-control-center (1.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  - Default applications - allow one to change the File-Manager defaults
  - Lots of new and updated translators
  - bug-fix: Set search button/entry as sensitive when printers list is empty
  - Don't invoking Search when pressing CTRL+S - CTRL+F is the standard
    method to invoke Search and CTRL+S is to invoke saving
  - Privacy - Clearing File History now prompts whether to empty; now
    consistent with emptying the trash etc.
  - bug-fix: sound: Don't flip the balance and fade sliders in RTL setups
  - bug-fix: sound: alerts sounds are correctly defined when choosing an
    alert type
  - sound: Add a "None" option to turn off sound alerts
  - bug-fix: network: reapply connection on device when refreshing
  - bug-fix: network: add missing cancellable; this resolves odd crashing
    when adding but then cancelling network connections
  - network: Disable DNS entry if the automatic option is enabled in the
    connection editor IPv4/6 tabs
  - display: Add 32:9 to known aspect ratios; support ultra-wide monitors
  - keyboard: country matches should not be shown under a language name;
    e.g. searching for Italian shouldn't display country matches
  - bug-fix: ensure printing test pages work with temporary queues
  - bug-fix: disable commas from trying to be used to set the host-name;
    previously this caused extra unnecessary logs to be produced
  - bug-fix: resolve issues where the pop-up showing user avatars appeared
    over the top of selecting a new avatar
  - bug-fix: resolve crash when cancelling from connecting to a thunderbolt
    connection
  - Display "UPS" in the power panel if the desktop is actually connected
    to a UPS
  - Add a confirmation dialog when attempting to clear file history
  - bug-fix: Resolve duplicate entries that occasionally appear in the sound
    device drop-downs
  - Displays: ensure all screens are updated ('snapped') when a display
    config change is made; for example rotating a screen that is in the middle
    of two adjacent screens is now possible
  - Allow jumbo-frames to be used for network connections - MTU size increased
    to 65536 bytes
  - bug-fix: where a panel does crash, ensure that panel is not the last
    remembered panel so that BCC can be reopened again.
  - bug-fix: When searching, ensure that pressing ENTER does not activate an
    empty panel search nor result in reactivating the WIFI panel when on another
    panel
  * Packaging Changes
    d/control.in bump StandardsVersion; no addition changes required

budgie-control-center (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    Add support to specify a Touchpad's click-method - using finger actions,
    clicking on touchpad areas, disable recognizing touchpad clicks or using
    your hardware default (if any)
    Support fingerprint recognition for login (a lightdm greeter such as
    slick) as well as the lock screen (budgie-screensaver /
    gnome-screensaver). Distros are recommended to include their equivalent
    of the Debian fprintd and libpam-fprintd packages and/or document how to
    setup fingerprint support and enrolment now available through BCC - Users
    Super+Shift+P now in budgie-desktop v10.7 shows the new Power Dialog. This
    shortcut can be customised through the Keyboard - View and Customize
    Shortcuts - System
    Add printers button now longer shows the potentially confusing two
    equivalent buttons on the same screen
    About: Remove the Mesa prefix for the Intel Iris driver
    About: Add the distro's Build ID (if it has one)
    About: Add the current kernel version
    Background: Now shows all image mime-types - previously just jpg and png
    were displayed. This potentially allows desktop images to be displayed
    using a wider array of image types such as .webp
    Fix crash if no power profile is set manually through gsettings
    Fix occasional crash when entering the wifi page when not connected to a
    network
    Add missing interface name during network profile creation
    Update WWAN apn list only if device is available otherwise APN list from

    Lots of updated translation thanks to our wonderful Transifex community

    debian/control.in add requirement for budgie-desktop >= 10.7
    B/D policykit-1 to polkitd and pkexec (Closes: #1025549)
