budgie-control-center (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - changes described in the upstream release tag
      https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-control-center/releases/tag/v1.1.0
      Notable changes in this release:
      Printers: Add the ability to adjust the job task priority
      Info-Overview - overhaul of descriptions to correctly display
      trademarks, remove junk info and simplify strings such as
      CPU, Core and Processor.

    - Drop existing patch since it has been incorporated in this release
    - Upload to unstable since release can be built with both unstable
      and experimental gnome-desktop versions
  * Packaging Changes
    - drop budgie-control-center-dev since no longer required with this
      release.  No reverse dependencies in the archive exists
      so don't need to make a transition package
    - d/control.in - drop B/D libgnome-desktop-dev to current testing version
      42.3 since this release will build with v43 and v42 - rebuild as
      part of a future GNOME 43 transition.
      Add libgnutls28-dev as a B/D
      Remove libsoup2.4-dev as a B/D
