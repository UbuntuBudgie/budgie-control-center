budgie-control-center (1.2.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    Add support to specify a Touchpad's click-method - using finger actions, clicking on touchpad areas, disable recognizing touchpad clicks or using your hardware default (if any)
    Support fingerprint recognition for login (a lightdm greeter such as slick) as well as the lock screen (budgie-screensaver / gnome-screensaver). Distros are recommended to include their equivalent of the Debian fprintd and libpam-fprintd packages and/or document how to setup fingerprint support and enrolment now available through through BCC - Users
    Super+Shift+P now in budgie-desktop v10.7 shows the new Power Dialog. This shortcut can be customised through the Keyboard - View and Customize Shortcuts - System
    Add printers button now longer shows the potentially confusing two equivalent buttons on the same screen
    About: Remove the Mesa prefix for the Intel Iris driver
    About: Add the distro's Build ID (if it has one)
    About: Add the current kernel version
    Background: Now shows all image mime-types - previously just jpg and png were displayed. This potentially allows desktop images to be displayed using a wider array of image types such as .webp
    Fix crash if no power profile is set manually through gsettings
    Fix occasional crash when entering the wifi page when not connected to a network
    Add missing interface name during network profile creation
    Update WWAN apn list only if device is available otherwise APN list from mobile-provider-info may not be properly loaded
    Hide the thunderbolt panel if no thunderbolt devices/capabilities are detected. This mimics Wacom panel display/hiding
    Lots of updated translation thanks to our wonderful Transifex community
